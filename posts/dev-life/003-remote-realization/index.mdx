excerpt: the realizations of a first time remote dev
---

This past week there has been a declared pandemic for the COVID-19 virus. The outbreak started a few months ago in some countries and then throttled to almost the entire world.

As I feel for the people who have suffered, and who have yet to suffer such virus without much aid from their government and their community, I started practicing _social distancing_ since this weekend (3 days now), and I urge you to do so, too.

The science is everywhere for the power of social distancing and proper hygiene. You can look it up through the news, to the articles of certain medical agencies, or you could also navigate the seas of articles (fake or not) within your beloved social media outlet.

But what does this mean to a software engineer/dev/magician? This means working remote (from home). For some devs this is already natural, but to most devs especially juniors, and especially those living within a third-world country, working from home isn't normal.

You don't usually have a good internet connection, a productive working space, some office necessities, and the easy access for help from teammates within an office.

And so for companies eagerly providing those for their devs in this time of need, I appreciate you so much. (though my appreciation doesn't really mean that much haha)

But more than the appreciation of kind and empathetic companies, I would like to emphasize on key learning realizations during my first day as a remote dev combined with the tips from experienced remote devs:

- **Time shifts to become excessive**. I've realized I have a ton of time to spend for the day. I don't get to spend time to travel, to obssess over what to wear and how to look, and to be anxious over small talks and conversations with people.

- **Cost of travel**. I didn't really actually realize the time spent traveling, the time spent waiting for transportation, and the money that comes with it until I stopped doing it. It's crazy!

- **Expenses, in general**. Working remotely, you aren't exposed to different restaurants, shops, and other tempting snack stalls. You get to save so much money from not snacking, not travelling, and not being exposed to consumer things, in general.

- **Having a work space**. When I was a student, and having to live with 6 of my family members, there really isn't a study area. You get your bed and you get to deal with the atmosphere that comes with 6 people in a small house. The importance of a work space when working remotely **cannot be emphasized greater**. Without it, you're left in this constant distress where productivity drops to almost nothing. Focus is paramount, and that is why in most third-world countries, devs usually go to an office to remove that problem.

- **This brings us to routines**. Set routines on when and where you work, and when on where you take breaks so that your mind can focus on what to do on specific places and time. It totally works if you set an alarm so you can trigger cues for certain time slots, otherwise, the line between work and your me-time can be very blurry and dangerous.

- **Overcommunicate**. Being out of the office, and only having to communicate with your team virtually, you have to overcommunicate. Your problems, your thoughts, your decisions, and your questions. Clear your assumptions and answer them with your team, and working remotely won't be a problem! I did this today and it felt great!

These realizations were the most prominent today, but if I come up with a new one, I'll update this blog post immediately!

As much as this pandemic brings so much grim vibes, it ain't stopping me from growing and appreciating the good things that is currently happening.

So, remember to wash your hands and practice social distancing so we can end this pandemic!

Don't be selfish!
