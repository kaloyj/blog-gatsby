### Date: August 7, 2019

I graduated my Bachelor's Degree last December 2018 and got hired around the last week of January.

Time travel to now, August 2019, and have learned a lot of things not just technically but a whole lot of thingies! Also, imma go about this randomly as it comes to my head so if the "categories" of the things i write about goes crazy, it's just all the random important things I learned within the first 6 months as a dev.

1. More rendered work hours DOES NOT measure productivity.

   I strongly put my foot on this one as I have met people who brag about their rendered "over time" work and feel so good about themselves, like? It's just not how it is.

   The thing about having to "over time" too much or even just at all, is that you overwork your will power + your brain's mental activity to the point of having to be exhausted and drained the next day. Also, during this over time work, your body will stop functioning properly. You analyze things a lot slower, you get distracted easily, you process things for the sake of being finished, sacrificing the whole process of understanding the pros and cons of that certain choice, and a lot more side effects. It doesn't stop there. The next day, you are exhausted and that current day's goals are affected. It goes on.

   It's not just me. There have been studies about this and it has proven true. Science backed it up, and I backed it up, and you probably know this too.

   So give yourself a break, and don't overthink it too much.

2. Meetings are important! (for the right reasons, and if done right!)

   So what do you do to avoid having to render more work hours while having to successfully (?) achieve the goals of your sprints?

   Plan it properly! Know yourself and have your team understand that you are confident with this specific time range and if we shorten that time range, deadlines will probably not be met. Talk it out on how the team can shorten it by helping you in certain things that may cause some delay in your development and compromise.

   But if they wont help, understand, or compromise, then shaky battle towards the deadline shall commence.

   Also, talk about the specifications and your geared solution/implementation towards the problem at hand so that when you go to "development mode / coding", you only have to think about translating the DISCUSSED and THOUGHT ABOUT solution and not think about other things on the fly. As per my experience, this is the primary cause of slow development. (and a lot of refactors too)

3. Appreciate a good mentor.

   Being new in the dev world, you get little chances of having a good mentor. One that is very open to help (don't abuse it!), one that gives feedback to your work in a professional manner that doesn't implicate any sense of you being a bad dev, a mentor that appreciates your work and corrects it if need be, and a mentor that is open to change, or to be thought of things too. (because learning doesn't stop!) Also, if you are really lucky, a mentor that gives you the opportunity of growth and freedom while still having that overlooking guidance in case you need it. Now that's a gem! That'll take you to the next level!

   If you don't have a good mentor, or a mentor at all, appreciate and observe the people around you (physically or digitally). No matter how rude, intelligent, crazy, obnoxious, toxic, selfish, or whatever adjective you see in people, there are always things you can learn from them. Trust me, I did.

   And if those people you do not admire make unsolicited comments about your work or even about you, then brush it off. Don't take the time to think about things from people who don't matter to your growth. (but still observe them though, helped me a lot!)

4. Love yourself more!

   Always prioritize yourself. Above everything. Let them call you selfish if you take the time to destress and recompose. Let them call you things and just breathe. Because in the end, you are all you have. And without you, the work, the money, the people and the other things, they're gone too.

   So take the time and appreciate yourself. Because I know you're doing more than enough.

   But don't get me wrong though, being solely selfish is different than prioritizing yourself over your work, or anything really. Because the key word is prioritize. You have to know the balance and where to allocate your efforts into. Self love doesnt mean you forget about your work. Or you forget about other people. It's just having to love ourself first,Â  before serving and doing your work. It's a fine line. But when you see it. Never take your eyes off it!

5. Appreciate the people!

   The work is good, but the people is what makes it amazing. Take the time to realize and appreciate the people around you who makes every little time worth while. The people who supports you, who shows you how to have a good time, the people who recognizes you when you are unrecognizable, and the people who makes you grow and be better. The people!\

6. Write about it!

   Writing makes me remember things, a lot! And if I forget about how to do a certain stuff, I can just read about it with my own words and my own learning style. It also makes you see your implementation or your thoughts in a bigger picture, and you often see lapses and problems while doing so. So it's definitely a SUPER win!

7. a lot more!

   I'll write more when I remember and realize things. So this might soon not end at number 7! Stay tuned!

To self when you read this 6 months later from now (a year in dev), you have to be more loving and caring of yourself and have to be more sensitive to others and open to concepts other than the one imprinted on your own, okay?? There's a lot more room for growth, and there are a lot of learnings to learn!

So see you in 6 months!
