excerpt: to the kid who was ever unsure

I was born out of poverty - family of seven, both parents didn't have work,  and no real family income to assist any family needs. The only person that kept us afloat was my grandmother, then eventually our eldest sister, which by the way should not have been her burden (but that topic is a whole another post )

That being said, each kid in the family was implicitly tasked to bring the family out of poverty, because what else could we do? **_There's nowhere to go but up._**

We weren't really pressured directly to do so, but that's not to say that the intention wasn't there. Alright, that's enough with the poverty back story, since this is getting almost really personal.

With that in mind, career options are limited to what can possibly cash out the most possible income, and in the shortest possible time. There was little room for experimentation and failures due to, you guessed it, financial problems.

So this leads us to the topic of this post, how being a web developer/software engineer/computer magician has eased up our lifestyle a little, in spite of it not being my ideal career option.

College came and I took Computer science. Don't get me wrong I love video games and I'm a huge nerd but that doesn't really equate to loving Computer Science as my academic program. (at first). I didn't really know shit about coding and all its intricate details, but I still chose it anyway - because i knew in the end, the pay is good, and it'll help me alleviate the problems at home, or at least the problems kids shouldn't experience. (yeah kids referring me). And then maybe after I save up enough money, I can pursue whatever the hell I want.

My first year was rough. Mostly everyone in my majors class (introductory and intermediate)  knew the basics, or even more about the topics discussed. Tears were cried, and nights were wasted to catch up, and I eventually did. It took failing lots of quizzes and machine problems to catch up but I wouldn't want it either way. Those failures pushed me farther than I could've pushed myself.

Yes, there was pressure in succeeding as fast as I can because I didn't have the luxury to fail and retake such courses since they were expensive, but it just took the right amount of mindset shifts and the right circle of friends to always keep me going, and going, and going, until I eventually fell in love with the program and the people I met within it.

The rest was history, friends and I graduated with latin honors and then eventually got hired at a prestigious (as they would say it) company.

The pay was great, in third world country terms. **_Entry level (no experience) started at P30,000 (~$600) to P45,000(~$900)_** depending on your skill level and portfolio upon entry.

Now I would just like to take a second and appreciate that entry level salary range (again in third world terms) because in a year, I have supported my brother's college tuition, paid for internet bills, paid for basic necessities in the house, saved up money, and bought shit that I want.

This is such a big deal to me because before (during college and years prior), I would ration my P150(~\$3) daily allowance from my grandmother or sister (they interchange), to transportation cost, food, leisure, and school needs. My friend would sometimes (probably often, which I am really grateful for!) buy me lunch so I could properly ration my allowance.

And fast forward to now where I don't even have to worry about spending a little bit because i am **_privileged to do so._**

This post basically is a PSA to people like me, who are born out poverty and who do not have the luxury to explore their passions, yet, to take up a programming related course, because it does pay a lot. It does.

**This is not to say that it would be easy.** It will be hard. Lots of new stuff to learn and absorb. **_(But isn't that like most courses?)_** It took lots of evenings and weekends, a lot of help from friends, and a whole lot of support from the community to be where I am today. And I'm not even that far yet!

I'm currently employed at a new company with better mentorship and team dynamic than my last employer and it **_pays around P40000 (~$800) to P60000(~$1200)_** depending on your experience and skill.

And it will get higher! As you get better at your craft, your salary range will get higher. And if relocating is an option for you, the range will definitely be better in first world countries.

I'm very transparent with the salary range because I want you (a person like me) to see how much taking up a course like mine (or something related to it) would help you ease your lifestyle a bit. And maybe someday with much experience and knowledge, alleviate the financial problem of your family completely. (let's do it together!)

Also, it's not only for men!!! I get this a lot when I encourage relatives or a friend's younger sibling and they feel that it's not for them because coding/programming is only for men.

If an LGBTQ+ member like me could do it, (and millions more), you can definitely do it too!

God knows the tech industry definitely needs more diversity in its principles and workflow right about 20 years ago.

So, if you're a high school graduate, or someone looking for a new career shift, because this third world country is just flooding with financial problems, I urge you to take up coding/programming.

As for your passion, you can integrate it with tech! Or you could take it up after you've saved enough money! There's really no stopping you after it.

So I hope to see you, then! **Because it really does help, and it really is fun!**

P.S. I decided to make this blog post because I have seen on twitter tons of tweets complaining about how their 4-5 years academic program is equivalent to a P10,000 - P15,000 ($200 - $300) salary range. I know the government and that specific industry could do better, but at what cost? How much time are you waiting for the government to act up and do something? Not to be political, but it takes a whole lot of time and a whole lot of industry changes for that to happen.

Let me know what you think!
