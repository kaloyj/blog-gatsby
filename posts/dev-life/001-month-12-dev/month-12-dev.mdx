And we're back! I posted a **TIL: 6 MONTHS AS A DEV** blog regarding, wait for it, my dev experience in 6 months! (obvi ). You can check it out later and see the growing realizations and differences of such experiences.

Let's begin!

1. More rendered work hours DOES NOT measure productivity and passion for the work.

   Emphasis on passion. I've written on this before but there has been a much more vivid feelings regarding this topic. Clarity has been served. Having to work for almost a year as a new dev in outsourcing, you are exposed to the idea that you're client's needs are paramount to your success. Wrong people will encourage you to work extra hours, unpaid, because this indicates that you are passionate in helping your client's product grow beyond money, and not doing so will just paint the other picture.But this is wrong! It's just wrong. Not only does this encourage burnout, but (like my points in the previous post) this will inevitably slow down production in both quantity and quality of work! This endangers your body's natural cycle of proper productivity. What you can do better on, to help your client, is to **prioritize and juggle your work properly.** Studies and millions of other devs will back me up on this. This will keep you fulfilled with you work, have time for yourself, and have space for growth and assessment.Work is important, but it is not everything. It doesn't mean you're not passionate about it. You just are passionate about a lot of things, and you have to make sure that you don't use up all your batteries on one thing because in the end, you'll end up with nothing to give.

   so don't forget to recharge! (and always prioritize!)

2. Don't be too hard on yourself!

   Having to graduate school as an achiever, you expect so much from yourself right off the bat directly at work. Being an achiever isn't bad, but when you have unrealistic expectations set up for yourself and your work, you can get very toxic towards yourself, and sometimes to others.But as I've learned, one must be accustomed to the feeling of failure so much so that the word failure wouldn't have to hurt when you feel it. In the year that I've worked as a dev, I've realized the importance of continuously failing and having the proper environment to understand such failure. Be wary, though. Being accustomed and comfortable with failure doesn't have to compromise our goals for success. Failing often, yes, but always with the goal of growth and improvement.So if you're an achiever like me, remember that you only fail when you stop trying. So if you're still trying and growing, you're doing really good!

3. Earning money

   When you've worked for almost a year, you may or may not have saved some amount of money, but if you did, then you would know that watching your bank account grow is very addicting.

   There will be times where opportunities of having to expand your source of income will appear - like investing on this kind of business, starting this kind of process, joining this organization, and a lot more creative ways people do to earn money.And you will be enticed by the stories each process above will tell you and you will be motivated to join such process.The thing I learned about this is, yes, having to increase your income is such a good thing to prioritize, but at what cost? Is this process hindering your growth from your primary source of income? Is this process, although may be very beneficial to your bank account, fulfilling to you?

   Choose to do the things that make you feel giddy and excited when you do them. It may or may not have that much money in it, but you're going to be so happy and fulfilled with what you're doing that having X amount of money won't matter.

   I've learned this the hard way. Paid some money and learned it the hard way. I've grown from it so I hope you do, too!

4. Empathy and respect

   Sure being talented and quick to solve certain things are important, but is it necessary that we forget about respect and empathy towards the people beyond the work?

   In an industry where impostor syndrome is very evident, and the need to always impress other people is very clear (trust me, i know), we must learn to prioritize empathy amongst many things. Empathy towards the product, the users, and the devs that are working on it.A team with clashing egos and unhearing ears can only go so far in development until everything falls apart.So as a junior dev talking to the void that is the internet, I plead that you empathize with your team members whether they're new or have been there for a long time. Mentor each other, evaluate each other, and appreciate each other.

   So much can happen when we forget about the human side of development, but so much more can happen if we don't.

   So be human!

5. Growth

   I cannot stress the importance of growth over money, especially to entry-level or junior devs like me. No amount of money will pay for the experience and learning you will gain from a great mentor.So choose a good mentor! (like the point from my last post) Never stop growing, in any aspect of your life whether its work or personal.Because the money will come after. (It did!)

There are probably a lot more little things I've learned in the past 12 months but these are the things that stood out.

So, Carlo! Like before, please if you're reading this in the future, take care of yourself! You're doing fine (probably great), so stop overthinking and chill out, man! Let things take its course and just ride it the best way you can - with a dance!

See you in the next year! (or months, who knows)
