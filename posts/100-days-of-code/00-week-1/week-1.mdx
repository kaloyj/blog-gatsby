I might be using the hashtag incorrectly but this is my journey as a junior developer at my second company. I considered using the #100DaysOfCode hashtag because there was really no proper junior experience from my first dev job. No proper mentorship, improperly handled project management, burnout and the list goes on.

My second dev job though, which I am at this point of time am so thankful for, has all the missing parts of a proper entry level experience. Empathy, mentorship, patience, and a great team dynamic.

Was that too much for an introductory message? Anyway! In the past few days (5 working days) I have learned so much great things from my mentors (teammates). To list some down would include:

- Code composability
- Time management
- Apollo GraphQL
- Responsibility over code
- Empathy towards the product, the team, and the client
- Containers!
- Git!

And a lot more internal stuff. But this is not to say that all were rainbows and butterflies. As a junior, I often feel like I'm bugging my teammates too much for code reviews, for help, or even for just a talk.

This really isn't their fault as I overthink way too much and overcomplicate things in my head. In fact, the team at my new job are way too wholesome (and talented!). It's just really me still traumatized from previous experiences, i guess. **You see once you expose yourself to something toxic, it's not a one bath-cleanse all kind of thing.** It takes time. And I really appreciate my new company for understanding. (or at least I believe they do!)

With words like "oh no, please don't feel any pressure just at your own pace", or "you don't have to be sorry, it's totally fine". **Warms my heart.**

Everyday I'm reminded about how blessed, lucky, and privileged I am to experience such things.

Also, two of my PRs got merged to master! Just after 20 - 25 revisions, it finally got in LOL. Gotta remember and appreciate the little successes in dev. :)

Anyway! Know that i'm doing my best to get better with myself and my work!

See you!
