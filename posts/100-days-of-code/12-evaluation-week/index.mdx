It's April now! And that means our #100DaysOfCode journey that started the first week of January has now officially ended. April 1 (April Fool's) usually is full of pranks and jokes, so I'm hoping none of anything that happened today was one.

Because as of today, I'm now _a regularized employee!_

That means a more secure standing with the company, more vacation leaves, more benefits, and I'm officially a carebear!

We call ourselves carebears at the office (or at work, since technically with the pandemic there are no offices) and I think it's the cutest thing!

Other than it matches our line of work which is healthcare, being called a carebear or belonging to such group is just heartwarming.

Especially with such talented, patient, and empathetic people!

And so, what remains of this #100DaysOfCode series?

As all great adventures go, like Frodo's, Harry's, and everyone else's, this is officially the end.

But that's not to say there won't be new ones!

Starting next week, I'll be posting more technical blogs now! Since within this series I've been sharing what I've learned every week, the new one will dive deeper on a particular topic and tackle every detail my brain can possibly tackle!

Primarily, this is to help me remember things in my own sense of learning process but additionally, this is also for people looking for solutions amidst the millions of blogpost on the interwebs.

But hey! Everyone is different! And it doesn't hurt to see things on different perspectives!

And so, to you, thank your for sticking with me on this journey.

I hope you had your fair share of journeys, too! Let me know on [twitter](https://twitter.com/carlojanea) and I'd be very glad to hear them!

And as I use to say every week, and probably the last with this series.

See you on the next one! (And next one I mean, the new series!)
