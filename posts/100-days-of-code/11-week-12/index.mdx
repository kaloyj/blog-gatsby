excerpt: the end of a journey

We're here. The final week has passed, and on the following week, we find out our fate. We braved through 100 days (~3 months) of coding as a probationary frontend engineer in the face of a new environment, new culture, and new challenges.

To say it was fun would be an understatement. It was a journey, from the first step we took inside the office and to the final code we pushed. We faced uncertainties, anxiety, and a hell lot of overthinking but it wasn't just for nothing.

We grew, so much more in the past 3 months compared to the past year before that, and we became better. We wrote cleaner and maintanable code, and we learned so much concepts â€“ both technical and personal.

So if I get to be regularized in the following week or not, it really wouldn't matter. To have learned so much things from very talented and patient people in such a short span of time, I simply can't regret anything.

I did the best that I could, I'm proud to say that, in the circumstances I was put in, and so the rest is up to them now.

And as I start to close this journey, the anxiety sky rockets. From what I believe and overthink often, these final moments are the most memorable to the company â€“ how I act, how I accomplish things, and how I evaluate things. These are the moments they will remember before they decide if I belong here, or not.

But these are all just me. _Me_, my biggest critique. As you may have read from the past, and from what I observed, people here are kind and rational so I may be exaggerating here.

But that doesn't stop the fact that my anxiety is just everywhere. Yeah, I need to be kinder to myself. ðŸ˜…

Anyway! That's technically the highlight of my week: having to complete this journey.

As to what I've learned this week, here are some of it:

- netlify forms
- html audio
- patience, as always
- kindness
- peace, especially with a glooming pandemic

Hope you're doing well with your journeys, too! I know it ain't easy, but hang in there! Let me know on [twitter](https://twitter.com/carlojanea) if you need a talk.

Also, for the next post, it would be the final one for the #100DaysOfCode series, and maybe an announcement for a new adventure?

Who knows! Haha, but for sure the tech journey for learning never stops!

See you on the next one!
