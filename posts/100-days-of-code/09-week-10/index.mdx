We're on our two-digit week! That's crazy!

What's even crazier? The _huuuge_ gap between my current perspective on things versus last week's.

The last two weeks were heavy. From a spectator's perspective (and from the future looking back), those two weeks were testament to how much I want to keep doing what I'm doing â€“ especially in the community/atmosphere that I am in.

_We_ felt trapped, and unsure in varying forms but we persisted, and within those experiences, we were learning. Learning to communicate and even _overcommunicate_. To find a process that's healthy and realistic. To ask for help and _just listen_.
**To always listen**.

But that was last week! This week was _very_ important. More than just being the light of a very dark tunnel, this week was
eye-opening.

The last two weeks were grueling because I approached a problem incorrectly, in the most unhealthy way possible. This left us to starting this week with a finished task and a new sprint (project cycle).

This means meetings, internal discussions, and patches. What part was eye opening? Two things.

- Appreciating the non-coding part of work
- Recognizing healthy patterns in solving issues
- Taking the first step towards that.

**The non-coding part of the week** left me in a daze, questioning "why I am not coding?", then realizing the importance of making the team (or at least someone in the team) understand the solutions to take and major decisions needed.

This made the experience a lot more universal, and less lonely.
And I really appreciated that. Something I will take on from this week onwards.

As for **recognizing healthy patterns**, this week I asked for help, and second opinions regarding my ideas. And I'm really proud of myself for that. (attributed to our past experiences of overthinking things alone)

And it wasn't so bad! It wasn't even an inch bad at all! Everyone was very much willing and understanding to help out, so see! The downfalls of overthinking!

As for our highlight of the week, as much as all the good things that happened _work-wise_, the highlight of my week was just a tiny part of work.

Just a normal day in the office, normal chat and conversations, and out of nowhere, my team mate recognized my favorite band plastered over my spotify app! He asked some details regarding Paramore (the best band ever) and I, the self proclaimed #1 fan, answered it instantly!

It's nothing much, but I really appreciated that. No judgment, no nothing. So nice!

Another one would be some lunch conversation, and as my regularization-decision-day is coming so it was a topic, and one of our team leads reassured me that I'll be permanent in no time. _"Don't worry, man!"_ in the most reassuring way possible.
Such great vibes towards someone who is anxious and overthinks a lot!

These little nuggets of conversations made me a lot more happy to be in this company of such empathetic, kind, and talented people. Highlight-worthy, right? Yuppers!

For my regular learnings this week, here are some of it!

- backwards vs forwards compatibility
- language paradigms
- solutions regarding forwards compatibility
- compiled vs interpreted
- WASMs and strict mode
- onBlur effect! (triggers on mousedown, who would've thought?)
- laptop screen sharing over an iMac at work!
- closures, and other javascript thingies!

There are probably a lot more but that'd make the list a whole lot lengthy. But rest assured most of it are JS related, thanks to [@getify](https://twitter.com/getify)'s book called **You Don't Know JS, Yet**

I also got to handle my first official GraphQL ticket! I made the queries, the client connection and logic, and the styles! I modeled it over an existing feature but I made sure to understand every process out of it!

All of these experiences this week are thanks to the trust my team puts on my shoulder, and the patience they hold when I stumble and ask for help.

Really super thankful!
