Week 11! That's literally one more week until our very last post! One last post before we find out if we become a permanent member of the company or if it's time we say goodbye to all the wonderful people and experiences we've encountered.

But as thrilling as that may sound, we must acknowledge the fact that this week and the week prior to that have been heavy. There has been a declared pandemic, with corresponding community quarantines, and even lockdowns. Businesses closed, employees were let go, and some are, luckily, working remotely.

Heavy times.

Working on tech, we are privileged to have the option to work from home â€“ privileged to just have that option. But many aren't. And that just sucks. It does.

But let's halt the sad train, temporarily. To return to our regular programming, we begin with how our week went!

_Remote_. Working remote is difficult, but it has its perks. Difficult in a sense that the line between work and home can be very blurry, and once blurry, it can become very unhealthy.

One day you're just exhausting yourself from work, and one day you just feel like a slump. The line is lost and the separation between the two comes with it.

But that's not to say I haven't been more productive. I could see this practice, _in the long run_, make me feel more productive. Less anxiety and consciousness about unnecessary things in the work place, and more focus on the work and the team.

But that's on the long run. The first week is hard, especially without transition. You don't know what works in terms of environment, tech setup, team dynamics, and the such.

I had so many down times (being unproductive) figuring out what works for me at home, what boundaries to set, what practices, and etc. I had to figure out how to build a setup where working remotely will not lessen the developer experience within the codebase, and I had to overcommunicate with the team regarding issues, ideas, and questions.

It's a lot to figure out especially with the pandemic anxiety hanging aroudn your head. But thank god, I figured it out.

Here's what worked for me.

For remote development:

- SSH for command line access to remote computer
- TeamViewer for testing the product without having to set up project again
- local codebase, for optimum developer experience (push to branch, pull via ssh, test in teamviewer)

For my _remote_ environment:

- a table separate from my room and super far away from my bed
- a gigantic water jug
- blasting fan/ac
- live recording of concerts

We may differ on preferences but these are mine. It took me five days and at the end of Friday I realized, I could do this for a very long time given that things are setup this way.

Okay coolsies! As for our highlight of the week, I'd have to give it to when our CEO asked us to work the weekends. This may sound as the opposite of what I've been writing about in the past few posts, but hear me out.

He asked in a way where we could decline. It wasn't a mandate, but it was an offer. Given that it was an offer, working on weekends had compensation. Emphasis on _compensation_.

Past employers would not have said anything, but would have inferred we are open to working on the weekends/over time.

See it's not even the recognition/compensation that matters, it's the thought of having your feelings considered.

And that means a lot.

Also, we're on a tight deadline since we're a health care company and there's a pandemic so ya know, demand for certain services are on an all time high; so I would have worked overtime with just a little nudge haha.

As for my weekly learnings, here are some I could remember:

- apollo cache updates! (through IDs!)
- local cache read/write after mutations
- teamviewer vs macbook pro screensharing
- patience with a new environment
- the team dynamic

So, yeah! Not much tech learning this week as most of the time was spent figuring things out.

But enough about me, how bout u? How was your first week with this pandemic sitch?
