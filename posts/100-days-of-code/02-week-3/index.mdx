It's a trilogy! Well if this was a movie then it would have been a trilogy, but this is more than a movie! These are my experiences and we need like infinite amounts of trilogies!

Okay movie goer, calm down. üòÖ Today marks week three (3) of my probationary period at my current company, which by the way I appreciate very much as you've seen from previous posts, and a lot of things went down!

Confession time! The day I started working at my current company, I overheard my team talking about a previous probationary employee and how he didn't qualify to be regularized. I didn't get the full story as that would just seem nosy and insensitive to the guy who was not regularized. By the way we got to the topic because we were talking about college friends/acquaintances and he (the guy) was a common connection. Just to put it out there that we didn't talk about people's qualification out of nowhere üòÇ

Anyway, having to know that an acquaintance didn't make the cut, these past few weeks have been gut wrenching as I, an overly overthinking human, could not stop thinking about it.

I couldn't stop thinking about it because **_I really wanted to stay there_** and it would suck to leave as everything I've wanted from a company -- culture, mentorship, attitude, and talent -- is present. I told myself that if I wanted to be here then I will have to do everything in my power to not fuck this opportunity up.

But this didn't stop the idea of not being there creep into my head every once in a while.

So, I decided to talk it out with our team lead. I casually sneaked the conversation about the qualifications needed to be regularized during 'pantry' talk.

I told him that **_I'm really worried about fucking things up_** and end up leaving this amazing company I really wanted to stay in (well not the 'amazing' part as that would just seem too on the nose üòù). I asked what are the qualifications and who gets to evaluate who.

He answered the basics of the questions (who gets to evaluate who and the basic criteria/qualifications needed to be passed) but proceeded to this amazing conversation which I really needed. This team lead (which I also talked to in the previous post), for some reason, has the uncanny ability to just know what I'm really feeling behind these questions and then responds with the most assuring and empathetic responses ever.

He basically said that I don't have to worry about anything since I'm doing a pretty good job at work. Just keep doing what I'm doing and that **_he believes in me._** He believes that I'll be a regularized employee in no time.

That might have been the most anti-climactic story telling you've ever read, but to me? that moment helped me move forward with whatever it was that I was feeling. It pushed me forward without having to feel additional pressure on my shoulders. The part where I know someone believes in me and my work, it just motivates me to be better. It's not even an ego boost, it's just **_pure reassurance_** that someone supports me in my endeavors and someone understands the struggle.

I might be looking way too deep into that conversation but that happened last Friday (today's a Thursday the following week) and it really did help. A lot.

Anyway! That was the highlight for my trilogy week. As usual, I've learned a lot even when I'm working less (relative to my previous job where I usually overtime). Here are most of the things I've learned this week:

- React.memo()
- underscore.js and recompose
- more docker/container things
- server and cache mutations with Apollo
- React and Apollo dev tools
- useEffect and useCallback with event handlers
- Framer Motion funsies!

As you can see, I get to handle tickets regarding Apollo GraphQL now! And update from Week 1's commit number to master, I probably have a total of 6 to 7 commits now! I know I really shouldn't measure productivity or accomplishment with number of commits but I gotta tell you I love the process achieving 1 commit to master. Our lead reviews our code thoroughly and gives feedback so great that I get to learn so much things with daily tickets! That's usually where I learn all the things I'm listing above.

Also, did I mention I found the library section of the company? It's filled with great resources for learning almost anything! Programming languages, design, software architecture and etc!

This week I'm reading: **_The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman._** As I've read, it's mostly about how to design things that are functional, visceral, and reflective. It's a great book to channel inspiration on how to create things. I haven't finished it yet so I can't talk more about it üòÜ

Alright that's it for this weeks #100DaysOfCode.

Hope you had a great one, too! (Or if not, then that's fine too! we gotta appreciate the downs in being a dev! and I hope it gets better üíì )

Let me know how it went on twitter! @carlojanea

Okiedokie, thanks for catching up with me! See you on the next one!
