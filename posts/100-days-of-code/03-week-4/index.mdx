Four! Wow! A month??Â  That's a month-worth of work!

Jeez, calm down, louise. This week was pretty uhhhh normal. I can't really sugarcoat anything and make it appear like all the days of being a dev is magical and inspiring, butttt, what can I say? This week was just 5 days of normal-ness.

UNLESS

unless? Uhh, unless we see through the normalness and seek within! (Okay 2010 emo blog writer, slow down).

Normal? This week was just a week of coding, eating lunch with the teamsies, learning stuff, being paranoid for no reason, overthinking, and the likes. You know, typical dev stuff.

Deeper! Okayyyyyy, this week we tackled new features meaning new tasks to do as an engineer. (or dev, or coder, or whatever you wanna call it). We discussed logic, reasonings, possible alternatives and solutions to such wonders and WAM! End of the week. What really stood out the most was my development not only as a coder but as a person, really, regarding my views of expectation.

This week I had realistic expectations. That's it. I'd say that's a contender for the highlight of my week. I didn't fully pressure myself to finish a task in a 2-day allnighter. I didn't overestimate my abilities as a dev and sought through the problem one day at a time. I didn't underestimate the problem at hand and grasped it as much as I can. I also voiced out my plans to the team regarding schedules and my day to day output.

It really was a great development overall as before, I would have these over the top expectations about things and it would end up with me facing all the consequences of such thinkings.

**_But this is not to say I did it all on my own._** I really could not have developed such realistic expectations paired with such open communication without **_the team enabling such things._**

The team I am currently at with my new company provided me with so much space to grow, to make mistakes, to ask for help, and to have fun (most especially!) that it resulted with such great development without additional pressure on my shoulder. I could see my mental health slowly pace to be better, and my code actually is wayyy much better now than the weeks or even months before (proven by our team lead appreciating my code and only asking for one tiny revision with my PR and immediately merged it!). Also, overall timewise, my code can scale better! That means less time for magically tinkering around components and accidentally breaking things, which means less time overall spent on such feature!

Side note before we continue! You may think I put wayyy to much meaning onto these PRs and commits and etc and it may not matter to you or so, but as a junior dev, these really matter as reviews from these PRs somehow document our growth (or at least mine) and it really does let me know that somehow I'm doing something right and towards something good.

Alright back! The whole point above is, with the right environment and the right people enabling your potential, or somehow enabling your growth to its maximum, anyone can be better at what they do. No matter what field or what activity, it is the core for improvement. (at least with what I've experienced myself)

Wooop, alright let's stamp that and make that the official highlight of our week.

Here are what I've learned this week!

- Docker (and containers in general! thanks @frontendmasters)
- more code composability learnings
- open communication
- realistic expectations
- formik setValue()
- framer thingies!

I also got featured in @cassidoo's newsletter for solving the weekly interview question! Looking forward for the next one, too.

As for our weekly book readings, I'm still with **_Emotional Design by Donald Norman_** like last week's book since I didn't get the read time I usually do!

Alright! Thank you for sticking with me on my Month 1 blog post. Appreciate ya!

See you on the next one!
