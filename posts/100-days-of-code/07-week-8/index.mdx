Heya! That got pretty _dark_ on the excerpt part, didn't it?

Well, cause this week was, uhhh, challenging in so many aspects - but mostly in terms of my emotional and mental health.

Emotionally and mentally, I was feeling all sorts of stuff, from the guilt of imposter syndrome to feeling like literal shit out of nowhere. Well it'd be impossible to feel that **literally** but you know that feeling where you're just not functioning like how you want to, like you're just disappointed about not solving this particular problem properly? Like you could definitely give out more? Yeahp, it's crazy.

There's definitely pressure. Not from the environment, or from the people around me as they are very supportive (you may have read from previous posts) but from me, personally.

I have this dangerous tendency of expecting to perform outstandingly with things. And as dangerous as it is a tendency, it comes with a dangerous downfall.

I never give up, though, so at the end of most dark days, somehow I find to see a glimpse of something I can use for the rest of the day, and the following days to come.

And this cycle, as vicious as it may seem, keeps me going. I have to admit something has to change – perspective, habits, or something more innate – because I know if I keep this going, something is going to break.

So I'm shouting this to the void that is the internet, starting today, February 27, 2020, things will have to change. Today marks the beginning of a journey that shall enable a more healthy mindset towards work, life, and me personally.

So! Patience, selflessness, and humility. These are what we're practicing and these shall be our goal for at least two months!

I'll update you guys every week so we can see the changes (good or bad) unfold.

Anyhoo! This week wasn't all bad. I learned so much things like:

- Forking OSS and playing around with it
- input time HTML5
- input masking
- pagination logic
- importance of plans!
- patience!
- VS Code thingies (thanks [@frontendmasters](https://twitter.com/frontendmasters))

Yup! I started learning tips and tricks with VS Code with Burke through Frontend Masters!

That class was so fun to be in, I definitely had way too much laughs.

Here's to hoping for a healthier way of working professionally and with myself.

And to you! Hope you're having a blast! (Or if not, then let's hope for the better together!)

See you on the next one!
