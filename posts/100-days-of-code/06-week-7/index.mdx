Number seven! I seriously thought to myself "that's a big number", well, because it totally is! To think we started this journey with so much anxiety, issues, and uncertainties, and to see ourselves here. It's amazing! And we definitely have a lot more journeys to walk on, so let's go!

This week was pretty interesting. [Last week's post](/100-days-of-code/week-6) was all about finishing the project set-up, and so to follow, we got to grab project tickets again!

It took some time to adjust solving problems again but after all troubles and challenges from setting up the project, I couldn't be more excited to solve all of them. (or at least what was assigned to me.)

But more than solving problems again, the highlight of our week is once again **empathy**. So much has happened this week that I can 100% say that the company I'm currently working in has empathy intertwined with their culture and values.

It's like taking care of each other's mental health and well-being is a natural thing and something they don't have to think about anymore. It's something I genuinely aspire to become no matter what field I am thrown upon, and is something I'm super thankful to experience and grow from.

These standards of company culture might sound mediocre or substandard to you, but coming from a place where burnout is glorified, manipulation, harrassment, and just a toxic workplace in general, these things are a light to behold. It's something that I genuinely treasure, and sometimes stop and ponder about.

Also, I'm still very hesitant to describe previous work environments I have worked on, but let's just call them for what it is. _Liberation._

So enough with the theatrics. What did really happen this week that sparked the highlight of empathy?

First, was our team lead reassuring me every step of the way that I should never feel pressure in finishing a ticket (or case) as soon as possible. He was earnestly there to answer all my questions regarding decisions and implementations towards the problem, and the moment I asked him if this was supposed to be done right about now (with, by the way, my mind going bonkers by overthinking things), he said

> Oh nooo, please don't put any pressure on your work and yourself. Just at your own time.

And I've never felt more assured and safe in a working environment. And guess what, I finished it hours later! This was possibly attributed to the weight of thinking I'm a burden and a slow dev taken out of my shoulder LOL. (haha yeah _I gotta be more patient and understanding with myself_)

Also, I don't take this patience for granted. I know they understand I'm a junior developer so they want to provide a safe space for growth, but I'm not making this as an excuse to slack off. I use the time to carefully review my own work, think of other composable solutions, run through my ideas to the team (or just the lead), and assess if such solutions are maintainable.

And if not for the healthy environment I am currently in, I wouldn't be able to do such things and improve my output.

Okayyy enough with work. Another thing that has happened that reallyyy stopped me in my tracks was during lunch break when I was talking with our financial manager.

We were talking about each other's travels and experiences and the tips and such for each destination. What shocked me greatly was when she referred to me as a member of the LGTBQ+ community in the most non-discriminating way possible. She used my pronouns right, she addressed me in such a way that sexual orientation wouldn't had changed a thing, and we clicked on our ideas in the most safe and comfortable space possible.

And this is true to all the people in the company (~14 people), never was I questioned about my sexual orientation from day 1 and even until now, because why should they? An environment where it shouldn't matter and _should just be normal_ is why I'm very happy I belong here.

And lastly, was when we had our afternoon snack break today (thursday, February 20, 2020). There were three of us there and two were my teammates. They were simply just talking about mental health, and what they were going through. Obvi, everyone was so supportive in the most non-condescending way possible. They let them share their pain and never invalidating their issues. It's so normal that there was never a dumb joke about having a psychologist/psychiatrist equating to being crazy.

It was such a wholesome experience that I got to _feel_ normal for what I'm feeling and what I'm going through. I've never felt weird about wanting to go to therapy, which in the end made me feel weird.

So seeing them talk about it and de-stigmatize such issues just literally brought me to a pause, and reflected upon how great empathy is embedded within each and everyone (or at least the ones I've interacted with) in this company.

See! Empathy, amirite!

As for our weekly dose of learnings, here is the list for what I've learned this week:

- patience with myself (in all my shortcomings and weaknesses)
- empathy!
- gatsby (been transferring my wordpress site to gatsby!)
- react date-picker
- Date object for JavaScript
- SSH thingies!

Super thankful for sticking by with me! We've got a lot to go so I hope you're still there with me in the future! (Or not, I totes understand!)

Hope you have your does of empathy in your workspace too!
