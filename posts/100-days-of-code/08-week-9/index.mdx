March! We're at March now (2 months since we've started) and we're closing on our 100 Days of Code journey! Who would've thought?

I definitely did, and didn't.

I've always known that I would make it this far (and longer!) knowing this achieving ass who would not settle for anything just barely passing. A heart for growth and persistence was what I started this journey with, and I plan to end it the same way.

But I also didn't expect the things that came my way, which mostly are personal things. I knew from the start that this will be hard, and that it would entail more challenges than before and that I would persevere, but I didn't realize the realness of it – the physicality of the trials and how intense it would hit me, mentally.

To prepare for something would lessen the blow, but facing it head on – looking it straight in the eye – that _crashed_ me so good it echoed mentally and emotionally.

Being a dev, tickets and cases are just tickets and cases. They are problems awaiting for solutions to solve them. The challenge is on _me_, the dev. The challenge of being patient, kind, understanding, and consistent not only with code, but with the overall relationship with the company, the people around it, and with me.

Surface level, that may sound simple and straight-forward, but when you have to think about that day to day, thinking of each action you make, each _reaction_ you make, each code you write, and each word you say, it weighs differently.

And so as I move forward with this journey, I ask myself to be patient. To be more understanding, that mistakes are meant to be made and feedback is meant to be there. To understand that nobody thinks you're annoying for asking for help, for asking for reviews, and for sharing your thoughts. That you are just doing your job, and so is the people who will collaborate with you.

That you are worthy of being there, because you _definitely_ are! And if people think otherwise, then it's not your fault! because you know you've done all that you can with the best that you could _at that specific moment_.

So be kinder, Carlo! You're doing great. Communicate, reach out, and understand. Nobody's gonna be mad at you for doing your job, and for being human.

Alright?

Okay!

As for my weekly learnings, here are some of them!

- date_fns library
- more react-datepicker thingies!
- the importance of colocation!

As I ask myself to be more kinder, I urge you to do so, too!

With yourself, the people around you, and the work that you spend time on.

As always, thank you for sticking by! Even on my down ones. Totes appreciate it.

See you on the next one!
