Alright, the title might be too aggressive but hear me out.

Some call it being thrifty, and some call it being stingy. They both boil down to the idea of having to save money deliberately, or of without choice.

I, for one, am in the middle. What does that being in the middle mean? I really want to save money so I can save up for the right things to spend on (so that's the deliberate part), but coming from a background with so much financial problems, saving money and being stingy is actually the only option for me to **_spend_** money on the right things. (the no choice part).

So I'm in the middle, okay cool. I'm being stingy to save up for the right things. Got it.

**_But at what cost?_** What do I actually sacrifice by being stingy?

A lot, actually. A lot of things people who aren't worried about saving money don't get to handle and experience.

Scenario 1 and the only scenario I'm sharing with this post, which actually happened this morning is this. Context is I'm commuting from my house to work. In the Philippines, there are commute options and here are the most common with the prices I spend on a daily basis and the overall time (wait/hail + travel time) it takes:

- Jeepneys: cheap but with a longer travel time. (16 PHP or ~\$0.30 and takes 1hr and 10 mins)

- Non-verified Motor Taxis: price is shaky depends on the driver but **_a range does exist_** on the correct price. This usually takes around 30 - 40 mins). Note on this as this is part of the following story below.

- Motor Taxis via Mobile App: price is 120 PHP or \$2.40. Takes around 40-60 mins

- Taxi: price is around 180 - 200 PHP or ~\$4 and takes the same amount of time as a jeepney (1hr)

- Taxi via Mobile App: price is around 200 - 250 PHP or ~\$5 and time is around 1hr and 20mins

- Bus/E-Jeep: relatively cheaper than the above options except a jeep. Price is 20 -  25 PHP or ~\$0.50. Takes longer time as waiting time is longer (1hr and 20mins)

As you see there are a lot of options. You may weigh in the one that suits your situation best like if you want comfort, speed, or the price.

But the story for this scenario starts with me choosing speed (since I was almost late to work and I hated waiting for jeeps under the molding sun in Southeast Asia) with the flexibility of adjusting the price of such commute (since we're stingy, remember?)

So the route taken was with the **_Non-verified Motor Taxis._**

I hailed one along the road near our house with a price in mind already. I have been riding non verified motor taxis for like, uhm, 1 year and more now? So I know the price range drivers usually ask for. The lowest is 100 PHP (~$2) and the highest is 150 PHP ($3)

So when this motor taxi driver stopped, he didn't ask for my offered travel price, right? I was thinking oh cool he just accepts whatever the rider wants. Cool.

We travel under the heat of the sun, over the traffic brooding across the city, and finally reached the location where I work.

I hand him my thought out price (which is 100 PHP, the lowest I could go since we're stingy right?) and this is where the fazing begins.

He complained, in the most complain-y way possible and even with the slightest tint of anger. He said, "100? Are you serious? It's 150!". I try to be calm as possible as I know if this proceeds to be a heated argument and possibly a fight, I would easily break.

I then told him, I've been riding motor taxis every morning and all I've given is 100 PHP. Drivers haven't complained ever since.

This was a lie by the way. I don't ride motor taxis every day to work. I do ride them everyday going home from work and I give 100 PHP to 120PHP most of the time.

He then replied, "If you would have told me you were only giving 100 PHP, I wouldn't have traveled here!", and then continued with, "Can you add 20PHP and let's just call this off? This is just crazy. It's supposed to be 150!"

I was standing my ground on only giving 100PHP and proceeded to reiterate that I've been always giving 100 PHP for 1 year and it's always been that. I didn't know why. I couldve easily given the 20 PHP but somehow I didn't. Was it pride? Was it me being stingy? Or was it something else?

Also, I'm writing this experience down because I can't get it out of my head. **I'm fazed.** Fazed by the experience, and fazed by my actions. Why did I do that? Why couldn't I just give him the 20 PHP? Did I just put a target on my back? Am I gonna be targeted and killed soon?

Alright these might sound like extremes, but it is possible! He knows the road where I wait for jeepneys or motor taxis so it's easily a ploy.

But as I was willing to die on that hill of only paying 100 PHP. He surrendered and let me go.

But did he? He's still with me though. As I write this down, he's still with me. His disappointment, his anger, his reasons, his reaction, and his possible actions.

Fazed. I'm fazed for being stingy. But should I be, though? 100PHP is a fair price, on the lowest range, but it is still fair. Was it my fault he didn't ask my price before accepting the ride? Definitely not.

I'm not totally at fault here. Probably no fault at all! But my inner overthinking ass, anxiety, and  conscience is fucking kill me man.

Let me know what you think on twitter (@carlojanea), and I'll let you know if I'm still fazed by the experience.

Okay, that's it.

Thanks for hearing me out.

Stingy man out. Peacez
