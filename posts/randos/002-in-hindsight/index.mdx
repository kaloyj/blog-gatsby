excerpt: looking back at how I behaved in college
---

3 years after I’ve finished college, almost a year of living alone, sitting with my thoughts, and contemplating past behaviors, today I decided to deconstruct why I behaved a certain way through the college phase of my life.

I’d like to believe I did a lot of good things through college, but I’m very much aware of the fact that the me in college, is far from who I am now.

I used to think that my personality in college was who I am at that time, and that I just grew out of it. But having to look at it in hindsight, most of the personality I had in college was out of insecurity and survival.

Insecurity fueled how I behaved and wanted to be perceived by other people, and survival pumped the gas and drove it. I was poor, lonely, undriven, and mediocre. I had to be ashamed of all of these, and hid them the best way I could – _pretend to be something I’m not._

I preferred hanging out with the _rich_ kids, or the people topping the class. I acted the way I did so that I could seem acceptable to their standards. I wanted to stand out and be recognized so that at least in school, it wouldn’t feel so lonely and unfulfilling.

This lead me to joining orgs I didn’t even believe in, doing activities to be seen in public, even if I had no business playing the part, and being overly competitive even to my own circle.

It was bad, even then I knew it was bad, but having to look at it retrospectively just makes it clear how bad and toxic it had gotten.

So to anyone I’ve ever wronged, and in one way or another, offended in the past, I really do apologize. This doesn’t excuse any of it, but I’m acknowledging why I did it, and I’m continuing to make peace with my actions and the reasons behind it, and working hard everyday to be better.

I still do have insecurities now, but I’m a lot secure in who I am and who I want to be – and letting others carry the burden of my insecurities is not one of them, and will never be again.

Looking back, yes I played the cards I was given, but I could’ve played it better where the expense of others wasn’t involved.

I guess experience, therapy, and a whole lot of internal dialogue really goes a long way.

Anyway, this is to a better well-rounded person, one who makes mistakes, reflects on them, and learns.

See you on the next one!
