excerpt: how moving out revealed the realities of Lady Bird
---

"Lady Bird", if you are unfamiliar, is a coming-of-age film by Greta Gerwig that showcases the mundane life of a teenager trying to navigate life the best way she can, head on. The power of the film lies on the beauty of shared and familiar emotion. Scenes are so reflective of life, you'll see yourself on screen even if you've never actually experienced it.

Until you do, and then you realize how strong the feelings punch you in the gut.

And it did.

As I move out of my house, which I lived 21 years in with my family, I understand stronger the struggles and the overall emotion Lady Bird was going through.

To begin, I've always empathized with Lady Bird. I belong to a lower middle class family, having lower middle class struggles. Pretended to be something I'm not including where I lived, and _how_ I lived. Had big dreams, loved theater, broke some relationships, unsatisfying first times, and a whole _lot_ more of similarities portrayed in Lady Bird.

For so long, I thought I understood everything she was going through.

Well, I guess because I did.

It was when I decided to move out how I realized what _I didn't understand_ was the intensity of all of it.

How going through all of it would be so different than just having to view it through a screen and say "Ah yes, I know that feeling!"

Example one would be the **constant transition of being aggressive to being caring** while having to interact with family, especially your parents.

The guilt that you experience afterwards, and the assurance that your family understands that this is normal just feels different. Sometimes just a healthy banter, sometimes toxic.

Another would be **their reaction to your independence.** Having to live within a conservative, family-centered society, being independent can come as an act against all of it.

Strong personalities from family members would come out to either try to stop you from leaving, or guilt trip you on how bad and ready-to-fail this whole plan is.

And having to experience all that - the manipulation, the brainwashing, the guilt trip - is just mentally draining, sometimes to the point of a mental breakdown.

Like Lady Bird, I'm just glad that I've found certain validations from other people who matter to me, who'll support me through this without reservations.

And I know by heart that this is something I want, and is the most right thing to do for me - mainly for growth, but mostly for peace.

But among all these feelings, the one that hit me strongest was **the actual feeling of growing up**.
I can't help look back and see how much I've grown as a person, and how much more of it I still need.

I'm not gonna lie, there's a certain sense of gratification and accomplishment knowing that I'm doing what I want and how I want it.

And even if this sense of autonomy and independence don't assure a full proof successful life ahead, it puts me at peace knowing that I'm making this decision, and no one else.

And if it's up to me, _there's definitely no stopping this achiever!_

And as Lady Bird remembered and recognized all the things that has happened in her home town, I'm doing the same. I'm super thankful, privileged, and lucky to have been supported by my grandmother, my tita, my sister, my siblings, my peers, and most especially my mother.

Moving out, at least for me, is not forgetting about experiences. It's moving past them and having to continue on growing.

And I totally understand if that's not the case for most people. Growth can come across people in so many different forms, and no one has the right to judge people for pursuing that.

Anyways, this is to pursuing growth, peace, and dreams.

Thanks for sticking by and reading this life piece.

Hope everything is well for you, too! And if not, that's okay. It'll come around.
