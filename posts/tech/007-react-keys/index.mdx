excerpt: how I overlooked one important rule with react keys

Well technically, my blindspot.

I was tasked to handle a very specific case/scenario where keys were involved, and it really took me two hours and a few hacky solutions to figure out the root of the problem.

### Too long, won't read

Use **unique and consistent** strings as keys, especially across re-renders.

### Some Background

Across my 2 years of React experience, I've always just thought of keys as something unique, something to identify the element across re-renders, so React can efficiently pinpoint the location in the react tree where things have changed and work on that said tree location accordingly. ([Reconciliation](https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html))

### The Problem

Cool, nothing wrong there.

_Yet._

I was tasked to handle this case/scenario where a form was operating on a piece of data, that generates a new `id` every time it got saved. This was for the purpose of having some sense of history and logging for said data.

Think of it this way _(a very contrived example)_

```javascript
const SomeParentComponent = ({ itemsThatChangeOnSave }) => (
  <div>
    <h1>A list of things that change on save</h1>
    {itemsThatChangeOnSave.map(item => (
      <div key={item.id}>
        <ItemDetails item={item} />
        <EditSettingsPopup item={item} />
      </div>
    ))}
  </div>
)
```

`item.id` as key is always unique, but since every time we save it, it changes, the whole purpose of a key during react's reconciliation phase, gets lost.

This might not seem very important in most cases, but in cases where state is involved within `ItemDetails` or in `EditSettingsPopup` where it has a nested popup that will save `item` and return to the main `EditSettingsPopup` then it will be a problem.

All of the state will be flushed or reset since react recognizes this as a different element in the react tree, which causes an unmount of the old key, and a mount of the new key scenario.

### The solution

Use a key that is **unique and consistent** across re-renders.

In our case, since we're generating a new record for each save of `item`, we made sure that there's a property that binds all the `item` records together.

And so that common property is what I used now as key.

And all my problems are gone!

Just 1-2 hours of wacking my brain on why state is resetting, and finding alternatives to nested popups, just to be bitten by react keys!

A total blindspot.

Not time wasted, though. It was definitely a solidifying experience.

Let me know if I missed something or I'm explaining something incorrectly on [twitter](https://twitter.com/carlojanea)

Will totally appreciate it!

Thanks for sticking by! I know it has been quite a few months since my last post, but know that I'm learning and keeping myself sane and healthy during all these pandemic troubles.

Hoping for the best for you, too!

See you on the next one.
