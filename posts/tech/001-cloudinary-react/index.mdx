excerpt: creating a custom upload hook
---

So I was making a side project that needed to manage uploads of multiple images and to make sure that modification of such image would be fairly fast and easy.

You can totally handle this yourself (upload endpoint + image modification) but having not to invest much time on such endeavor, I decided to use [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)

Disclaimer: You can alternatively use the [cloudinary-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cloudinary) to create an upload endpoint yourself instead of creating this custom hook, either way, both achieve the same results, it all depends on your use-case on how to handle the returned response.

Alright, to begin, we first need to create a file called `useCloudinary.ts` (I'm using typescript, and you can name it however you want), and this is where our custom upload hook will be born. ðŸ˜€

```javascript
// provided by cloudinary in your account
// used for upload purposes
const cloudName = process.env.CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME
const uploadPreset = process.env.CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET

const useCloudinary = () => {
  const uploadFiles = () => {
    // cloudinary upload here
  }

  // we include cloudName, and uploadPreset
  // so we dont keep accessing the environment variables
  return { cloudName, uploadPreset, uploadFiles }
}

export default useCloudinary
```

For typescript users, we first need to create a type (or interface for people who prefer it) for our upload method inside our `useCloudinary` hook.

```
type UploadFilesFuncType = (files: FileList | File[]) => Promise<string[]>;
```

It may receive a `FileList` or an array of files because I'm using [react-dropzone](https://github.com/react-dropzone/react-dropzone) to handle uploads and selecting multiple files returns a `FileList` while dragging multiple files returns an array of type `File`. Both are iterable and return a file so they eventually do the same thing, just different data structures.

Our upload method also returns an array of strings which will hold the result of the upload method. We're using type `string` because we want to either store just the url of the uploaded image, or a stringified object to be passed to the server.

In my use-case this is an array of stringified objects because I'm passing this down to my server to save the URL and the publicId of the uploaded image (context below)

Next, we fill in our `uploadFile` method inside our `useCloudinary` hook.

```javascript
const uploadFiles: UploadFilesFuncType = async files => {
  const url = `https://api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/${cloudName}/upload`
  let images: string[] = []

  for (let i = 0; i < files.length; i++) {
    const formData = new FormData()
    formData.append("upload_preset", uploadPreset)
    formData.append("tags", "test-uploads")
    formData.append("file", files[i])
    try {
      const result = await fetch(url, {
        method: "POST",
        body: formData,
      })
      const image = await result.json()
      images.push(
        JSON.stringify({ url: image.secure_url, publicId: image.public_id })
      )
    } catch (e) {
      console.error(e)
    }
  }

  return Promise.all(images)
}
```

Let's break this down.

```javascript
const url = `https://api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/${cloudName}/upload`
let images: string[] = []
```

The url endpoint is provided by cloudinary to allow users to upload images via the client side.

We create an array of strings `images` to keep hold of the returned object, but stringified. Again, this can be of type-anything but in my use-case I'm stringifying the object result because I needed to pass this to my server (which will parse it) and save the data accordingly.

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < files.length; i++) {
  const formData = new FormData()
  formData.append("upload_preset", uploadPreset)
  formData.append("tags", "test-uploads")
  formData.append("file", files[i])
  // ....
}
```

We iterate through our files (which is of type FileList or File[]) to individually upload them since this is the functionality provided by the client-side endpoint.

You also need to use `new FormData()` as this is the expected request by the endpoint.

Through this `formData` we are required to pass two things: `upload_preset` (provided by your account) and `file` (the file to be uploaded).

You can pass in more data in `formData` depending in what you need (transformations and stuff). [Here's](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_upload_api_reference#unsigned_upload_parameters) the list you can refer to.

```javascript
//... uploadFiles body
try {
  const result = await fetch(url, {
    method: "POST",
    body: formData,
  })
  const image = await result.json()
  images.push(
    JSON.stringify({ url: image.secure_url, publicId: image.public_id })
  )
} catch (e) {
  console.error(e)
}
```

We then make a POST request via fetch API (or with your preferred service) and stringify the result that we want.

```
    return Promise.all(images);
```

We finally return the stringified objects stored in `images` when all the Promises are resolved.

We can finally use our custom hook!

```javascript
// add types/interfaces accordingly
// This is our ImageUploader component
const ImageUploader = ({ name, label, uploadedImages }) => {
  const { setFieldValue } = useFormikContext()
  const { uploadFiles } = useCloudinary()
  return (
    <Dropzone
      onDrop={async (files: File[]) => {
        const images = await uploadFiles(files)
        setFieldValue(name, [...uploadedImages, ...images])
      }}
    >
      {({ getRootProps, getInputProps }) => (
        <section>
          <label htmlFor={name}>{label}</label>
          <div {...getRootProps()}>
            <input
              {...getInputProps()}
              name={name}
              onChange={async e => {
                if (e.target.files) {
                  const images = await uploadFiles(e.target.files)
                  setFieldValue(name, [...uploadedImages, ...images])
                }
              }}
            />
            <p>Drag and drop some files here, or click here to select files</p>
          </div>
        </section>
      )}
    </Dropzone>
  )
}
```

So I'm using Formik and Dropzone to handle my form and image uploads. We're using our `uploadFiles` method in the onDrop and onChange handlers of our Dropzone component.

And that's it! You now have a very pluggable custom upload hook!

A bonus tip!

When you're using [cloudinary-react](https://github.com/cloudinary/cloudinary-react) to display your images/transformations, note that their `CloudinaryContext` is not really a React Context, but just a wrapper to provide the passed data to its children.

Say you have this component

```javascript
<CloudinaryContext cloudName={cloudName} uploadPreset={uploadPreset}>
  {/* children here */}
  <Image />
  <Transformation />
  <SomeComponent />
</CloudinaryContext>
```

And within `SomeComponent.tsx`

```javascript
// ERROR!
// Ideally we expect data from CloudinaryContext
const data = useContext(CloudinaryContext)
```

This isn't possible because CloudinaryContext here is just a wrapper, not fully a React Context. Refer to [cloudinary-react's](https://github.com/cloudinary/cloudinary-react) source code for more details. This bit me so hard it took some hours to figure out why useContext wasn't working. ðŸ˜€

Anyway! That's it! Hope this post helped you!
