excerpt: clarifying what goes on within a react portal
---

So during this week, I was tasked to do an overlay (or a modal) and decided to use React's [portal](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html) feature.

It was cool and all, until the confusion kicked in. Everything worked perfectly (with the docs' help), but something was off.

I didn't fully understand what was going on with what I was using!

So as usual, here's my train of thought explaining to myself how portals work.

### Portals in Code

From the docs, translated to using hooks, here's what a portal would look like

```javascript
// assuming you have a <div id="root-id" /> in your app
const modalRoot = document.getElementById("root-id")

const Portal = () => {
  const el = useRef(null)
  if (!el.current) el.current = document.createElement("div")

  useEffect(() => {
    modalRoot.appendChild(el.current)
    return () => modalRoot.removeChild(el.current)
  }, [])

  return React.createPortal(children, el.current)
}
```

If you were like me, at first glance (or twenty), the code above wouldn't seem so straight-forward.

What's really happening here? Do we append child first then create the portal? Why do we need to create a separate element `el` and not utilize `modalRoot` in `createPortal`?

All these questions were running around in my head making me more confused than before.

### Portals, deeper

Let's break it down on how react processes our code above with the help from this useful lifecycle [cheatsheet](https://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-lifecycle-methods-diagram/).

First would be the one outside the component itself.

```javascript
const modalRoot = document.getElementById("root-id")
```

No mystery there. Next would be where the lifecycle cheatsheet would matter.
We don't have a constructor so mounting would be first.

```javascript
const el = useRef(null)
if (!el.current) el.current = document.createElement("div")

return React.createPortal(children, el.current)
```

As you can see we're skipping the `useEffect` since that equals to componentDidMount and willUnmount. This will happen after mounting.

What happened here is we created a ref `el` and if it didn't have a `current` yet (or it hasn't been assigned to anything), then we assign a div element to it.

We then use `el` to create a portal.

But all we have really is a portal contained by `el.current`. We haven't really _entered_ the portal. To enter (and exit), we proceed with our `useEffect`

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  modalRoot.appendChild(el.current)
  return () => modalRoot.removeChild(el.current)
}, [])
```

We simply append it to our modalRoot to enter after component mount, and remove the `el.current` on component unmount.

Tada! We have a fully functional portal!

You can use it via:

```javascript
<Portal>// stuff you want to transport to modalRoot</Portal>
```

### But why not use modalRoot directly?

```javascript
const modalRoot = document.getElementById("root-id")
const Portal = () => {
  return React.createPortal(children, modalRoot)
}
```

With this, we immediately create a portal to the root and not worry about mounting and unmounting. Right?

Same thoughts here. Every demo or blog I've read always had an unnecessary div that will be appended to modalRoot.

From experience, using modalRoot directly doesn't really change the experience. I can still use multiple portal instances of `<Portal />`, and mounting/unmounting still works perfectly fine.

Like any other portal popup situation, I would have to call it this way:

```javascript
const SomeComponentThatNeedsPortals = () => {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false)
  return isOpen ? (
    <Portal>// some children to mount within the portal here</Portal>
  ) : null
}
```

Unmounting/mounting of the portal content is already handled here - using modalRoot directly or not.

I guess it all falls to convention and getting used to? But personally I prefer using `modalRoot` directly. It's lesser to process mentally, and it's pretty straight-forward.

Alright, that's it for portals! As always, corrections, questions, and clarifications are very open through [twitter](https://twitter.com/carlojanea)

Would totally appreciate it! Especially corrections regarding using `modalRoot` directly.

See you on the next one!
