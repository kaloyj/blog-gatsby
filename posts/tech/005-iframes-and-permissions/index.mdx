excerpt: figuring out how to pass permissions across iframes
---

This issue is mainly for the Chrome browser (starting Chrome 60) since you have to explicitly describe what kind of permissions a user can grant for certain privacy settings like camera, microphones, screen capture, and [a lot more settings.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Feature_Policy)

To do this, you'd have to do the following:

```
<iframe src="https://somelink.com" allow="camera; microphone; display-capture" />
```

Emphasis on the `allow` attribute

Other browsers handle them internally, or if not, require you to do it manually via settings, as far as i know.

### So what's the issue exactly?

The issue is when you have nested iframes. Say **iframe P** (parent) has an inner iframe, **iframe C** (child) that have features that require the camera and microphone.

**iframe C**'s setup would look like this:

```
// iframe C (child)
<iframe src="https://some-origin.com" allow="camera; microphone; display-capture"/>
```

No problem seen here, _yet_. We notify chrome that with this iframe, we will ask permissions from users to access certain features (camera, microphone, and screen capture).

Now naturally, we'd think for **iframe P** to have the same permissions, we'd configure it the same way as **iframe C**.

```
// iframe P (parent)
<iframe
  src="https://some-origin-that-points-to-iframe-c.com"
  allow="camera; microphone; display-capture"
/>
```

We refer to it as _parent_ since within the `src` link that it points to, it will render **iframe C** (child).

### The Problem

The problem here is the assumption made above. If you didn't have this assumption, then you would have saved hours of your life compared to mine. ðŸ˜„

**iframe P** will not have, or even be asked to grant permissions to certain privacy settings. Why? This is caused by having two different origins, and the defaults within the `allow` attribute value.

```
// this statement
allow="camera; microphone; display-capture"

// will evaluate to this
allow="camera 'self'; microphone 'self'; display-capture 'self'"
```

What does the `self` default value mean here?

Self, from the [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Feature-Policy/camera), will allow access to this document, and all nested (child) browsing context within the **same origin**.

This explains why it will work if **iframe C** was standalone (no parent), because when we grant access to certain settings, we are operating under the origin we granted access to. (which is `https://some-origin`)

This is different when we have a parent iframe, since we are operating under that parent's origin, in our case that'll be `https://some-origin-that-points-to-iframe-c`, and the permission was granted to `https://some-origin`

### The Solution

In cases where you can adjust your code to change where you request for access over to the parent, so you don't have to change `allow`'s value, then you could do that.

But in cases where **iframe C** (the child) has to be the one to ask for permissions, you only need to change the value within `allow`.

```
// for iframe P (parent)
// change this statement
allow="camera; microphone; display-capture"

// to this
allow="camera *; microphone *; display-capture *"
```

The `*` value will allow all origins to ask for permissions for certain services. So now, even if **iframe C** with the origin of `https://some-origin` which is different from the parent's, can now ask for the user's permission for the camera, the microphone, or whatever you need!

And in case you're worried for security purposes, then the `*` value can be changed to the origin of your specific site

```
allow="camera <allowlist>; microphone <allowlist>; display-capture <allowlist>"
```

Hope that helped you! This would have saved me 2 hours of searching around solutions. ðŸ˜…
